Research Question:

How does ML/AI in medical journals affect citations over time.
Layers
1. AI/ML 2004-2025 -> Citations
2. By Subject -> time from grant to publication -> 
3. Institution -> by that answer geography

How AI and ML became mainstream. Citation counts. Author affiliation and geography. Institutions. Funding agencies.

Classifier that takes as input funding agency, author, and outputs a recommendation for research or not.
